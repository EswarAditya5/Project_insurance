### Abstract:
HealthyLife Insurance company has gathered the data regarding the customers and wants to analyze it. Different customers have different lifestyles and hence not all can have the same medical expenditures or requirements for health insurance. To better tailor the insurance package to be given to different customers, the company now wants to integrate machine learning into the process and identify the right insurance charges for each customer.

### Problem Statement:
Predict how much could be the insurance charges for a beneficiary based on the data provided using Linear Regression.
 
### Dataset Information:

| Column	| Description |
|--|--|
| Age	| Age of Primary Beneficiary |
| Sex	| Insurance Contractor gender (female, male) |
| BMI	| Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of the body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 |
| Children	| Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents |
| Smoker	| Whether the beneficiary smokes or not |
| Region	| The beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.|
| charges	| Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (target variable) |

### Scope:
- 	Exploratory data analysis
- 	Data Pre-processing
- 	Tuning the model to improve the performance

### Deployment with Streamlit
The insurance charges will be deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications with ease. The Streamlit application will enable users to interact with the analysis, explore visualizations, and make predictions based on the developed models. Access the deployed application through this link: [Streamlit]
